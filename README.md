# HackSC_2019
The leader is my senior, John Wang, and I am a member, who did backend and Google Map function in the frontend.
## The goal is to help local small store have a channel to sell their products. 
## On the other hand, we make a function, which assits users to compare the prices in several stores around their own location.
## In addition, we made a safe mechanism in order to protect the privacy. 
## Every store owner and customer is defined "user" and has to create a new account before using the App.
#
## The main functions:
1. list the price of products, store name, and miles from the user.
2. The store owner can easily upload the information of their products.
3. The customers can easily check the cheapest product and find the nearest store from them.
